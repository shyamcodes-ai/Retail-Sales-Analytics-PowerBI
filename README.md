🚀 Project Overview

Retail businesses often struggle to understand:

Which products drive the most revenue

Which customer segments are most valuable

How sales trends change over time

Without proper analytics, companies fail to optimize:

Marketing

Customer retention

🧩 Business Problem

Retailers lack clear visibility into:

Sales performance

Customer behavior

High/low performing product categories

Regional profitability differences

This limits the ability to make data-driven decisions.
